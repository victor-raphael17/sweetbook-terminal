# Welcome to SweetBook

The program is a scheduling and order calculator for sweets and cakes, primarily targeting confectionery shops.
This project was developed for a course in the Internet Systems undergraduate program at UTFPR-GP.
It's important to highlight that both user registration and orders lack security measures, as the project was created solely for practicing logic and OOP concepts.
A version with security features and a React frontend will be released soon, making the app truly useful.
Thank you for your attention.
